      <p>This is the space where we take a moment to understand what we’ve learned and the significance of our conversation and action. So, what’s been accomplished? What’s still needed? Is there an opportunity for more action or a new conversation that ought to be launched? What are the unanswered questions and who else should be invited to participate?</p>
